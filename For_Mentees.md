# Intro

Number 1 rule of Github for research: NO PROTECTED DATA GETS COMMITTED OR PUSHED!

Github is essentially social media for code, anything included is public.  Choose carefully which files get committed and whenever you add/receive/make a file that should not be published on the internet, add it to your .gitignore file to add an extra check that it will not accidentally be uploaded.  If that does not make sense yet, keep reading and then come back to this when you're ready to start.
